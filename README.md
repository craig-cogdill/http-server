Design Decisions:
- Use only the C++ STL for production code
- As few external dependencies as possible
    - Only googletest is brought in, for unit testing
- High reusability for future applications
- Maximum code coverage through unit tests
- Show what I know
    - Have not used GMock, so instead used a handmade inheritance Mock model for unit testing

Coding Goals:
- No raw pointers, unless unavoidable
- Don't throw, unless necessary
- As few comments as possible
    - Code should explain itself, and reserve comments for tricky, unintuitive sections, or to break
    up longer code sections
- Readability in favor of brevity

Assumptions:
- Each string in the first line of the request is separated by a single space
- Any request that doesn't specify HTTP version 1.1 is invalid
- Request will be generated by a valid HTTP client
    - Header strings with malformed such as "Content-Length= 8" or "Content-Length:8" will not be used
    - Header strings with mismatched key-values such as "Conten-Length: eighteen" will not be used
    - Headers will not be duplicated. I.E. having multiple "Content-Length" headers specified in one request
